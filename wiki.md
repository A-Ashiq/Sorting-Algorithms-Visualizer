## Algorithms
### 1. Bubble Sort
Bubble sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of Ο(n2) where n is the number of items

### 2. Selection Sort
Selection sort is an in-place comparison-based algorithm in which the list is divided into two parts, the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end. Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire list.This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of Ο(n2) where n is the number of items.
