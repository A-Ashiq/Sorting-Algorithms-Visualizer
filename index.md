# About the project


This project is basicaly a tool, made with python and **pygame**,  for visualizing sorting algorithms in a educational way. Our porpouse is to portray these algorithms so the user can understand how a computer "move some pieces" to achive his goal, having a sorted data at the end! <br> To accomplish our purpouse we are also working in a wiki page with algorithms explanations and visualization GIFS,  where the reader can have a better understanding about this topic.
